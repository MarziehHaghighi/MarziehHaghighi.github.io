Iâ€™m an applied AI researcher passionate about developing innovative machine-learning-based solutions to complex real-life problems,  especially those related to human health. Currently, I am a Research Scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. My journey in interdisciplinary research has spanned various fields such as brain-computer interfaces, medical imaging, and cell biology. Prior to my current position, I conducted postdoctoral research at the Carpenter-Singh lab, focusing on morphological profiling. I also worked as a Research Fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, delving into clinical MRI data.
